It lacks use towards the later game, but it’s always useful to have some on you for contracts. It is used in a variety of things, namely steel. Steel will have its own section however due to the sheer amount of things it can make.\nUsed in:\n Steel Iron rods Bolts Iron plates Wire Ammunition  "

The above build is currently the best build for any basic material (except steel). Although the picture may show copper, simply set the synths to iron and you’ll have the same output.\nWith Importers Not applicable. There should be no reason to use importers here.\nBeginners Iron (50) [50] {Very High} “Ching”\nA very simple build for beginners.

The answer is that we don’t have a good picture as of right now. Multiply this build 5 times over and you’ll get the output provided on top. The above build was made by “Tangy”!\n"

	"content": "Builds No Importers Iron Plates (40.01) [79.93] {Moderate} “Ching”\nThe first real build in this compendium. A very crammed build, but still effective. Grabbers are key here. The splitter on splitter design is a common trick us theorycrafters use. Basically the synthesizer can shoot stuff out at 30/s but belts can only carry 5/s. To make up for this, we use splitters on splitters, which cause 15/s to be sent out across the 4 points exit points of the splitters.\nWith Importers Work in progress\nBeginners Work in progress\nLarger Than 12x12 Work in progress\n"

	"content": "Chapter 1 Materials The compendium is split into several different “sections” based on the base resource of each build. Recycler, Underwell and “everything” builds will get their own section. Each section will consist of the following:\n A general overview to the resource and its use The end product of the resource  Best build no importers for the end product Best build with importers for the end product Best build for newer players (wip right now) Best build that doesn’t fit in a 12x12 micro factory   Other builds and points of interests,  Note that step 2 will be repeated for all end products, every single one of them! This will make the list pretty long, so I recommend using the table of contents.\nI also want to say thank you to the theorycrafting sub-discord for helping me make this, along with all the awesome people who made these builds. Also the Rockbite cause they made this fun game\nAlso, if you (yes, you the reader) have a terrific design that is better than the ones listed, please dm me a picture of them, along with some stability info.
